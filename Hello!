Hello friendly people ;) I’m new 2 coding, (mostly atleast).
I did however do a little HTML back in middle school 2 decades ago, then in high school did a lil' intro into C++ 
I’m currently learning how 2 use this website for now.
bought & assembled one of these quadraped robot kits a while ago (6-7month): https://www.amazon.ca/Adeept-Quadruped-Raspberry-Crawling-Self-stabilizing/dp/B07TLK5GP8?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=sat0sheesstor-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=b293cb35e6423338b496634405bf741f&camp=15121&creative=330641
btw ya thats an affiliate link. full disclosure. just figured why not, butmy primary reason  2 be here is to learn n share n dl stuff  :) 
I figure best place 2 start would be learning to code this robot so i can robot it around lol.
